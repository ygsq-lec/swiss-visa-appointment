# Swiss Visa Appointment Auto-Booking & Alert System (Playwright Version)

This project is a modified version of [winiz/visa_visit_alert](https://github.com/winiz/visa_visit_alert), originally created to monitor and alert users about appointment availability for the Swiss visa application.

This enhanced version replaces **Selenium** with **Playwright** for faster and more reliable browser automation, and adds several new features for improved usability and automation.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Playwright-based Automation**: Faster and more stable than Selenium.
- 🔔 **Appointment Slot Alerts**: Get notified when a new appointment is available.
- 🤖 **Auto Booking**: Automatically attempts to book/re-book an appointment when a slot becomes available.
- 🛡️ **Error Handling & Logging**: Improved robustness and debug logs.

## 🧰 Requirements

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro)

## ▶️ Usage
python swiss-visa.py
